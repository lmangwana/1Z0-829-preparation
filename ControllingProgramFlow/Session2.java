			Notes:

			3. Controlling flow with Transfer statements: return, yield, break, continue
			
			Answer:
			=>  Line 15 does not compile because the post-decrement operator can be applied only to variables not values. 
			=> 	Line 16 also does not compile because the label LOOP is out of scope after line 15. 
			=> 	Finally, line 18 does not compile because trick is declared within the do/while loop and is out of scope after

			->break and break numbers do same thing right? => Correct

			Answers:
			=> Since a break without a label applies to the innermost structure, 
				break and break numbers are equivalent and both of these two are correct answers. 
			=> Likewise, continue and continue numbers are equivalent although wrong in this case since they resume operation of the inner loop.

				Notes:
				1. No break statement, so fall through occurs. => Correct
				
				Answers:
				=> A var can be used in a switch statement, provided the underlying type resolves to a supported switch type.
			 	=> Next, notice there are no break statements. 
			 	   Therefore, Once the matching case statement, 30, is reached, all remaining case statements will be executed.

			Notes:
			1. Flow scoping understanding is checked hard!
				e.g. note the pattern variable is only created if the pattern match evaulates to true
			
			
			RECAP:
			Flow scoping is determined by the compiler based on the branching and flow of the program.
			-> so it works on the worst case scenario.
			-> if the compiler cannot guarantee a true result, pattern variable is not in scope and code does not compile.
			-> Think of it like this, if(pattern_match expresion) -> true, then pattern variable is in scope in the if branch. 
				We can have the else branch but should not include the pattern variable there!
				
				if(!pattern_match expresion) -> F, then pattern variable id created and is in scope in the else branch.
				We can have an if branch but not have the pattern variable there as it will not be in scope.
				
				Forget about pattern mathing for one second and focus on if-statement.
				This will either be true or false always! So either branch can be covered and thus its statements will be executed regardless.
				However, we cannot use the pattern variable just anywhere. It's scope is based on a true condition of the
				the pattern match within the if-statement.
			
			-> Lastly, Make sure you understand the way flow scoping works. In particular, it is possible to use a pattern variable
			   outside of the if statement, but only when the compiler can definitively determine its type.
			   
			   Example:
			    Object obj = "Hello, World!";

			        if (!(obj instanceof String str)) {
			            return;
			        }
			
			        // The compiler can definitively determine that obj is a String here
			        System.out.println("Outside if: " + str.toLowerCase());
			    }
			    
			    Explanation
				=> Negative Check: The if (!(obj instanceof String str)) check ensures that if obj is not a String, the method returns early.
				=> Definitive Type: After this check, the compiler can definitively determine that obj is a String, so the pattern variable str can be used outside the if block.
